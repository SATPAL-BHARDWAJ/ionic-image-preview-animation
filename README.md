# ionic-image-preview-animation
Have a look at the live demo, click on the image of the post and it will open the image preview modal with nice ionic 5 animation. We are using the same animation in the reverse for modal close.   When you try to vertical scroll on the image modal, it will close the modal and animate the image back to itâ€™s related post.  You can also use image zoom in and out by pinch on a real device.
